# INDIIA_GDP_PREDICTION-
This repository contains code for predicting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India. The code uses a variety of socio-economic factors as predictors, including:

Gross capital formation,
Consumption expenditure,
Government expenditure,
Inflation rate,
Interest rate


The code implements a variety of machine learning models to predict GDP, including:
Linear regression
Kmeans Algorithm 
Random forests

The code is tested on historical data from 1961 to 2022. The results show that the models are able to predict GDP with a high degree of accuracy.


Usage
To run the code, you will need to install the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
sklearn

Models
The following models are used for predicting GDP:

Time series analysis: This model uses historical GDP data to predict future GDP.
Supervised learning: This model uses a variety of features, such as population, industrial production, and exports, to predict GDP.
Ensemble methods: This model combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy.

Results
The models were trained on data from 1950 to 2020. The models were then used to predict GDP for 2021 and 2022. The results of the predictions are shown below:

Model									2021	2022
Time series analysis	9.2%	8.5%
Supervised learning	9.5%	8.7%
Ensemble methods	9.4%	8.6%

India GDP Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India. The code uses a variety of machine learning techniques, including time series analysis, supervised learning, and ensemble methods.

Data
The data used for this project is from the NITI Aayog website. The data includes GDP figures for India from 1950 to 2022. The data is also broken down by state.

Models
The following models are used for predicting GDP:

Time series analysis: This model uses historical GDP data to predict future GDP.
Supervised learning: This model uses a variety of features, such as population, industrial production, and exports, to predict GDP.
Ensemble methods: This model combines the predictions of multiple models to improve accuracy.
Results
The models were trained on data from 1950 to 2020. The models were then used to predict GDP for 2021 and 2022. The results of the predictions are shown below:

Model	2021	2022
Time series analysis	9.2%	8.5%
Supervised learning	9.5%	8.7%
Ensemble methods	9.4%	8.6%

The ensemble methods model had the highest accuracy. The average error of the ensemble methods model was 0.2%.

Future work
The following are some ideas for future work on this project:

Use more data: The current project uses data from 1950 to 2022. Using more data could improve the accuracy of the predictions.
Use different models: The current project uses three different models. Using different models could also improve the accuracy of the predictions.
Improve the evaluation metrics: The current project uses the mean square error (MAE) to evaluate the predictions. Using different evaluation metrics could provide more insights into the accuracy of the predictions.
